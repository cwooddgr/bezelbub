## Description (4000 characters max)

Bezelbub instantly frames your screenshots and screen recordings in pixel-perfect device bezels. Drop a screenshot or video, pick a color, and export a beautiful mockup — no templates, no layers, no fuss.

**How it works:**
1. Drag a screenshot or screen recording into Bezelbub or use File > Open.
2. The app automatically detects which device it came from.
3. Choose your device color to match the real hardware.
4. Copy to clipboard, save as PNG, or export framed video. Done.

**Automatic device detection**
Bezelbub analyzes your screenshot or video resolution and instantly identifies the matching device. Portrait or landscape, it just works. If multiple devices share the same resolution, you can pick the right one from a menu.

**Video framing**
Drop a MOV, MP4, or M4V screen recording and export it with the device bezel overlaid. Audio is preserved. Rotate videos to fix orientation, and choose a background color to complement your content. Export at custom sizes with aspect-ratio locking.

**Every color, every device**
Each mockup uses the actual device color — not a generic silver frame. Choose from every finish Apple offers, from Black Titanium to Cosmic Orange to Ultramarine.

**Pixel-perfect compositing**
Screenshots are precisely masked with anti-aliased rounded corners and layered beneath the bezel frame. The result is indistinguishable from a photo of a real device. Output is saved as full-resolution PNG in the sRGB color space.
