## Description (4000 characters max)

Bezelbub instantly frames your screenshots in pixel-perfect device bezels. Drop a screenshot, pick a color, and export a beautiful mockup — no templates, no layers, no fuss.

**How it works:**
1. Drag a screenshot into Bezelbub or use File > Open.
2. The app automatically detects which device the screenshot came from.
3. Choose your device color to match the real hardware.
4. Copy to clipboard or save as PNG. Done.

**Automatic device detection**
Bezelbub analyzes your screenshot's resolution and instantly identifies the matching device. Portrait or landscape, it just works. If multiple devices share the same resolution, you can pick the right one from a menu.

**Every color, every device**
Each mockup uses the actual device color — not a generic silver frame. Choose from every finish Apple offers, from Black Titanium to Cosmic Orange to Ultramarine.

**Pixel-perfect compositing**
Screenshots are precisely masked with anti-aliased rounded corners and layered beneath the bezel frame. The result is indistinguishable from a photo of a real device. Output is saved as full-resolution PNG in the sRGB color space.

**Supported devices:**

iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max
iPhone Air
iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max

**Fast and native**
Bezelbub is a native macOS app built with SwiftUI. It launches instantly, composites in the background, and never needs an internet connection. All bezel assets are included in the app.

**Export your way**
Copy the framed image to your clipboard with Cmd+C for quick pasting into Keynote, Figma, or Messages. Or save as PNG with Cmd+S for use in App Store listings, social media, or documentation.

**Perfect for:**
- App Store screenshots and marketing materials
